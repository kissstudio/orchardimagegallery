# Project Description

Orchard Image Gallery project is intended to provide an Image Gallery module for Orchard Project. 

The Image Gallery module provides means to upload images and organize them into galleries. These image galleries are used on Orchard to present images in a beautiful way, leveraging the existing Orchard JQuery feature.

Image galleries can be created as content parts or widgets. Also, the presentation style can be change based on the presentations plugins. For example, one can use PrettyPhoto and jQuery Ligthbox for traditional image galleries, and SlideViewerPro for presenting images in a slide view manner.
